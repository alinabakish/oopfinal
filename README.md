This fruits shop is created by Nuriza and Alinabakish. It was awesome, because it will give you opportunity to do shop online while you are sitting in your home. And, it has login and sign-up page. This was absolutely great. Because, each customer write their emails and passwords. I liked this project and wish you all the best:)

Hello . I will criticize the work, done by Nuriza ana alinabakish. And I tried to do some shop. It was enjoyable and easy to understand . By the way , as I am a programmer I looked at her code. Her code was understandable and clear without comments.  And also her shop has more features as free deliver if you buy over 20$. I liked it very much.
3. Azimov Talantbek. Good job! I hardly recommend this app to others. Because, it was created very good. The code is also understandable. And interface also created professionally. I really respect your work. And I am looking forward for the same great projects!

Everything is in place!It is very easy to understand and convenient to use! And very interesting interface . I like it! But, In my opinion you need to add some features like you can just message to customer and buy it. 
7. Dinara Tologonova. Let me say my opinion about this project. Firstly, it has some minuses,like not interesting interface , that will not attract clients to buy. But, for the second course student it is very good that you can do this. I liked that it has more choices and sign -up page.
8. Turat Belekov . The app is actually super cool. I liked it. But, I think that you must add some feauteres because of concurency. I liked mostly interface and pictures. Congratulations to her on this achievement! I look forward to the same cool projects!
9.  Aktan Kubatbekov.  Fruits shop or online shop is going to be popular in our days. And for programmers it would be the best app to practice and be able to do same projects. And, I appreciate your work. I liked that your project is helpful and understandable.
